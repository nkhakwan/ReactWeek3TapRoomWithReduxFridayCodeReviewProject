## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Clone this repository from GitHub.
2. In the terminal executs "run npm install"
3. Than execute "npm run start". There on display would guide you thru interface.

## Precaution 
#### To fill up the form of adding Kegs, it requires a URL for the picture of the Drinking Product. For Teacher's ready reference I am placing four picture addresses of various cities in Turkey to fill the form. You'll not see the picture of a drink with each product but each drink you add with the underneath URL's would be represented by a city of Turkey
